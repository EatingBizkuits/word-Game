<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## **About The Project**

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
<br>
<b id="how-it-started">How it started:</b>

Word Game is a game concept conceptualized 💡 by our very own team in <b>ORION</b> in preparation for Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Annually organised event, Amazing Race🏁, to be held on <u><i>March 16th 2022</i></u>. 

This event is intended to catch the interests👀 of Secondary School Students🧑‍🎓 to spark ✨ their interest in Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Infocomm Technology and kickstart their interest and talents in the technological sector. 💻
<br><br><br>
<b id="ongoings">How it's going:</b>

With the progress of the event nearing, we have been making improvements 👍 and efficiency changes 📈 to some of our processes ⚙️, with this as one of the few changes implemented. With this web application, we hope that users, the Game Masters 🎮 for our event, may be able to have an easier time ⏱️ to run the game smoothly during the event.🏃
